# Great SaaS Landing Page Criteria

## Must-Have Elements (Priority Order)

### 1. Hero Section (Above the Fold)
- **Clear headline:** What is it? (5 words or less)
- **Value prop subhead:** What problem does it solve? (1 sentence)
- **Social proof:** Who uses it? (number, logos, or testimonial)
- **Primary CTA:** Email signup (contrasting color)
- **Visual:** Product screenshot or demo

### 2. The Problem (Relatability)
- **Paint the pain:** Describe the exact frustration
- **Current bad solution:** What people do now (and why it sucks)
- **Make it personal:** "You" language, specific scenario

### 3. The Solution (Your Product)
- **How it works:** 3-5 simple steps with icons
- **Key features:** 3-6 bullet points (benefits, not features)
- **Demo/Screenshot:** Show the actual product

### 4. Social Proof
- **Early users:** "Join 127 people already signed up"
- **Testimonials:** Real quotes from beta users (if available)
- **Built by:** Your credibility (indie maker, shipped X products)

### 5. Pricing (Be Transparent)
- **Single price:** $29/mo (keep it simple)
- **What's included:** Unlimited captures, all channels, etc.
- **Launch discount:** Early bird pricing
- **Risk reversal:** 30-day money back (if offering)

### 6. FAQ (Kill Objections)
- **3-5 common questions**
- Short, direct answers
- Anticipate concerns (privacy, complexity, compatibility)

### 7. Final CTA
- **Repeat signup form**
- **Urgency:** "Limited early access spots"
- **Social proof:** "Join X others"

### 8. Footer
- **Contact:** Email or Twitter
- **Legal:** Terms, Privacy (even if just placeholders)
- **Made by:** Your name + link

## Design Principles

### Visual Hierarchy
✅ Large, bold headline  
✅ Generous whitespace  
✅ F-pattern layout (people read top-left to bottom-right)  
✅ Contrasting CTA buttons  
✅ Single column on mobile  

### Copy Rules
✅ **Clarity > Cleverness** (don't make them think)  
✅ **Benefits > Features** ("capture wins without breaking flow" not "DOM extraction API")  
✅ **Active voice** ("You click" not "The extension can be clicked")  
✅ **Specific numbers** ("30 seconds" not "quickly")  
✅ **Short paragraphs** (2-3 lines max)  

### Conversion Optimization
✅ **One goal:** Email signup (don't dilute with multiple CTAs)  
✅ **Visible CTAs:** Above fold + after each section  
✅ **Low friction:** Just email (no password, name, etc.)  
✅ **Clear expectation:** "Get notified when we launch"  

### Trust Signals
✅ **Real screenshots** (not mockups)  
✅ **Your face/name** (real person behind it)  
✅ **Transparent pricing** (no "contact sales")  
✅ **Privacy note:** "We hate spam too. Unsubscribe anytime."  

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Vague headlines:** "The future of content" (what does that mean?)  
❌ **Feature lists:** "AI-powered, cloud-based, synergistic" (so what?)  
❌ **Stock photos:** Generic business people pointing at laptops  
❌ **Long forms:** Asking for phone, company, job title, blood type  
❌ **Mystery pricing:** "Contact us for pricing" (kills trust)  
❌ **Too many CTAs:** Newsletter + Demo + Trial + Buy Now (pick one!)
