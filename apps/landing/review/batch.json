        "description": "Built an end-to-end App Store submission defense system after 5 rejections piled up. Created 5 scripts: `submission-gate.sh` (pre-flight catches 12+ rejection causes before upload), `asc-preflight.sh` (validates against App Store Connect API), `asc-monitor.sh` (dashboard of all app states), `asc-alert.sh` (state change detection), and `resubmit.sh` (enforces rejection logging before retry). Wired the gate as a hard blocker into the upload script - no more \"oops forgot to check\" submissions. Set up 15-minute cron monitoring that pings when Apple moves an app.\n\nThis is the difference between amateur and factory. Most indie devs submit → wait → get rejected → fix one thing → repeat. We now have: (1) systematic pre-flight that catches issues BEFORE Apple sees them, (2) a rejection database that builds institutional memory, (3) real-time monitoring so we know within 15 minutes when something changes. The factory learns from every rejection and gets harder to reject over time.",

Answer: No. Context window fills up during the coding phase - each SwiftUI view is 100-300 lines, build errors add output, and by the time code compiles, context gets compacted and the agent loses track. Practical limit is ~1-2 phases per session. Solution: multi-session with memory handoffs via BUILD-CHECKLIST.md.\n\nThis is a real constraint on autonomous AI coding. The fantasy is \"agent builds entire app.\" The reality is context limits create natural phase boundaries. The fix isn't bigger context windows - it's designing systems that checkpoint state to external memory (files) so the next session can pick up cleanly. Memory architecture matters more than raw capability.",

        "description": "Asked whether a spawned AI agent could complete the entire iOS factory flow (discovery → design → code → submit → marketing) in a single session. Answer: No. Context window fills up during the coding phase - each SwiftUI view is 100-300 lines, build errors add output, and by the time code compiles, context gets compacted and the agent loses track. Practical limit is ~1-2 phases per session. Solution: multi-session with memory handoffs via BUILD-CHECKLIST.md.\n\nThis is a real constraint on autonomous AI coding. The fantasy is \"agent builds entire app.\" The reality is context limits create natural phase boundaries. The fix isn't bigger context windows - it's designing systems that checkpoint state to external memory (files) so the next session can pick up cleanly. Memory architecture matters more than raw capability.",
