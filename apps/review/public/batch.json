One hotkey (Cmd+L) while working:\n• Captures what just happened\n• Generates 3 platform-ready posts (Twitter/LinkedIn/Instagram)\n• Emails you a review link\n• Copy-paste to publish\n\n30 seconds. No app-switching. No \"I'll post about this later\" (you won't).\n\n**The business model:** $29/month, no free tier. Why? AI costs are real ($3/user/month), and free tiers attract people who won't use it. I want serious users building in public, not tire-kickers.\n\n**Current status:** Review UI is live and working. Chrome extension starts next week. 4-week timeline to launch.\n\nPre-selling on Twitter first. If 10+ people want early access, I'm building it.\n\nThis is the difference between people who build in public and people who *want* to. Removing the friction.",

But they don't get shared because the friction is too high.\n\nYou'd have to:\n1. Stop what you're doing\n2. Screenshot the chat\n3. Open Twitter/LinkedIn\n4. Remember what was interesting\n5. Write the post\n6. Format it for the platform\n\nBy the time you finish, you've lost 10 minutes and broken your flow. So you don't do it.\n\n**The Solution:**\nHotKey removes the friction:\n• Hit Cmd+L while working in ChatGPT/Claude\n• System captures context + screenshot\n• AI generates 3 platform-specific drafts (Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram)\n• Email notification with review link\n• Copy-paste to publish\n\n30 seconds total. Zero app-switching.\n\n**Product Decisions:**\n\n**$29/month subscription (no free tier)**\nWhy? AI costs are $3/user/month. A free tier would attract people who won't use it. I want serious users building in public, not people collecting tools.\n\n**Chrome extension MVP (not native app)**\nWhy? Works everywhere (ChatGPT, Claude, OpenClaw web). iOS app is Phase 2.\n\n**Copy-paste workflow (not auto-posting)**\nWhy? User stays in control. Auto-posting adds complexity and trust issues. Manual copy-paste is fast enough and keeps the user in the loop.\n\n**Timeline:**\n• Review UI: ✅ Done (v1.0.0 live)\n• Chrome extension: Week 1-2\n• API + email notifications: Week 3\n• Beta launch: Week 4\n\n**Pre-sell validation:**\nBefore building the extension, I'm pre-selling on Twitter. If 10+ people want early access, it's a signal there's real demand.\n\nThis is the difference between people who successfully build in public and people who *want* to build in public but never do.\n\nThe friction kills the habit before it starts.",

Low engagement, no viral moments. Classic case of solving the wrong problem.\n\nSo I went back to basics and researched what actually makes content viral. Spent weeks analyzing patterns across platforms, documenting everything in HOOK-OPTIMIZATION.md and HOOK-COMPARISON.md.\n\nThe research revealed something striking: posts with strong hooks vs weak hooks showed up to 40x difference in engagement. Same exact story, different opening line = completely different trajectory.\n\nKey insight: Content quality equals hook quality. Your story is just raw material—each platform interprets it differently using proven psychological patterns.\n\nInstead of text manipulation, I'm now building AI that understands hook psychology first, then crafts the story around it. Not claiming magic results yet—this is honest research phase building.\n\nBut the system architecture is solid. When you study what works at scale, patterns emerge. Now it's about encoding those patterns into something that can replicate the process.\n\nWhat's your experience with content hooks? Do you lead with the story or the psychology?",
