But they don't get shared because the friction is too high.\n\nYou'd have to:\n1. Stop what you're doing\n2. Screenshot the chat\n3. Open Twitter/LinkedIn\n4. Remember what was interesting\n5. Write the post\n6. Format it for the platform\n\nBy the time you finish, you've lost 10 minutes and broken your flow. So you don't do it.\n\n## The Solution\n\nHotKey removes the friction:\n• Hit Cmd+L while working in ChatGPT/Claude\n• System captures context + screenshot\n• AI generates 3 platform-specific drafts (Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram)\n• Email notification with review link\n• Copy-paste to publish\n\n30 seconds total. Zero app-switching.\n\n## Product Decisions\n\n**$29/month subscription (no free tier)**\nWhy? AI costs are $3/user/month. A free tier would attract people who won't use it. I want serious users building in public, not people collecting tools.\n\n**Chrome extension MVP (not native app)**\nWhy? Works everywhere (ChatGPT, Claude, OpenClaw web). iOS app is Phase 2.\n\n**Copy-paste workflow (not auto-posting)**\nWhy? User stays in control. Auto-posting adds complexity and trust issues. Manual copy-paste is fast enough and keeps the user in the loop.\n\n## Timeline\n\n• Review UI: ✅ Done (v1.0.0 live)\n• Chrome extension: Week 1-2\n• API + email notifications: Week 3\n• Beta launch: Week 4\n\n## Pre-sell Validation\n\nBefore building the extension, I'm pre-selling on Twitter. If 10+ people want early access, it's a signal there's real demand.\n\nThis is the difference between people who successfully build in public and people who *want* to build in public but never do.\n\nThe friction kills the habit before it starts.",

The sophisticated templates we built aren't even being used.

Outcome-oriented DNA makes every post subtly work toward specific goals - DM invites, partnership inquiries, early access signups. The difference between \"I post on Twitter\" and \"Twitter is my lead gen engine.\"\n\nKey insight: Already got one $9.5k proposal from Twitter content. With outcome-oriented posts (soft CTAs, conversation starters, relevant invites), that could happen weekly instead of randomly. Not every post needs a CTA, but when they do (1 in 3), they should align with actual business goals and feel natural, not pushy.\n\nImplementation: Add \"goals\" section to user DNA with primary_outcome, target_actions, cta_guidelines (style/frequency/types/avoid), and value_propositions per domain (real estate, AI, SaaS). System prompts inject this so AI knows when/how to add soft CTAs that match the content.",

No more relying on context memory.\n\nThree orchestration options: manual (human triggers), chained (auto-spawn), or coordinator (single manager).\n\nWhy this matters: The solution isn't bigger context windows—it's decomposing work into phases that fit, with explicit state handoffs.\n\nThis pattern applies to any complex AI workflow hitting context limits. Make state external and explicit (JSON) rather than relying on context memory.\n\nWhat complex workflow are you trying to automate? Might be time to think in phases, not monoliths.",

        "description": "Added minimum temperature threshold (50°F) to Tennis booking system and created comprehensive HotKey documentation after Matt's tennis buddy got excited about the system.\n\n**The trigger:**\nMatt was playing tennis and telling his buddy about his automated booking system. Buddy went wild for it and wants one himself.\n\n**The changes:**\n1. **Added temperature rule to `schedule-tennis.js`:**\n   - `MIN_TEMP_F = 50` constant\n   - Temperature checks run BEFORE wind checks (priority order)\n   - Smart fallback: AM cold/PM warm → pick PM, vice versa → pick AM, both cold → skip day\n\n2. **Created `HOTKEY-READY.md` (14KB complete guide):**\n   - Full system workflow explanation\n   - Weather decision logic with example table\n   - File structure breakdown\n   - Setup instructions for new users\n   - Troubleshooting guide\n   - Sample schedule JSON output\n\n**Decision priority (updated):**\n1. Temp < 50°F → Skip ❄️ (NEW!)\n2. Wind > 10mph → Skip 💨\n3. Both playable → Prefer AM (free courts at Austin High)\n4. PM significantly nicer → Override to PM (SATC/Pharr booking)\n\n**The system in a nutshell:**\n- Friday 6 PM: Analyzes weather, messages 5 players\n- Saturday morning: Matt assigns players (10 minutes)\n- Daily 8:45 AM: Auto-books courts 48h ahead via Ripner\n- Daily 6 PM: Sends reminders\n- Time saved: 2.5 hours/week → 10 minutes/week",

Every Friday at 6 PM, it analyzes weather and messages 5 players. I spend 10 minutes Saturday morning assigning people. Then it auto-books courts 48 hours ahead and sends daily reminders.\n\nBut my buddy had one request: \"What about temperature checks?\"\n\nApparently not everyone plays tennis in 45°F weather like a maniac.\n\nSo I added MIN_TEMP_F = 50 with smart fallback logic. If morning is cold but afternoon is warm, pick afternoon. If both are cold, skip the day entirely.\n\nThe real work was creating 14KB of documentation. Workflow explanations, decision logic tables, file structure breakdown, setup instructions, troubleshooting guide. Making it \"HotKey-ready\" - someone can clone it and be running their own version in 30 minutes.\n\nHere's what I learned: The hardest part wasn't building the automation. It was making it transferable.\n\nGood automation works for you. Great automation works for anyone.\n\nWhat system are you running that others would kill for?",
