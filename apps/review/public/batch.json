But they don't get shared because the friction is too high.\n\nYou'd have to:\n1. Stop what you're doing\n2. Screenshot the chat\n3. Open Twitter/LinkedIn\n4. Remember what was interesting\n5. Write the post\n6. Format it for the platform\n\nBy the time you finish, you've lost 10 minutes and broken your flow. So you don't do it.\n\n## The Solution\n\nHotKey removes the friction:\n• Hit Cmd+L while working in ChatGPT/Claude\n• System captures context + screenshot\n• AI generates 3 platform-specific drafts (Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram)\n• Email notification with review link\n• Copy-paste to publish\n\n30 seconds total. Zero app-switching.\n\n## Product Decisions\n\n**$29/month subscription (no free tier)**\nWhy? AI costs are $3/user/month. A free tier would attract people who won't use it. I want serious users building in public, not people collecting tools.\n\n**Chrome extension MVP (not native app)**\nWhy? Works everywhere (ChatGPT, Claude, OpenClaw web). iOS app is Phase 2.\n\n**Copy-paste workflow (not auto-posting)**\nWhy? User stays in control. Auto-posting adds complexity and trust issues. Manual copy-paste is fast enough and keeps the user in the loop.\n\n## Timeline\n\n• Review UI: ✅ Done (v1.0.0 live)\n• Chrome extension: Week 1-2\n• API + email notifications: Week 3\n• Beta launch: Week 4\n\n## Pre-sell Validation\n\nBefore building the extension, I'm pre-selling on Twitter. If 10+ people want early access, it's a signal there's real demand.\n\nThis is the difference between people who successfully build in public and people who *want* to build in public but never do.\n\nThe friction kills the habit before it starts.",

The sophisticated templates we built aren't even being used.

Outcome-oriented DNA makes every post subtly work toward specific goals - DM invites, partnership inquiries, early access signups. The difference between \"I post on Twitter\" and \"Twitter is my lead gen engine.\"\n\nKey insight: Already got one $9.5k proposal from Twitter content. With outcome-oriented posts (soft CTAs, conversation starters, relevant invites), that could happen weekly instead of randomly. Not every post needs a CTA, but when they do (1 in 3), they should align with actual business goals and feel natural, not pushy.\n\nImplementation: Add \"goals\" section to user DNA with primary_outcome, target_actions, cta_guidelines (style/frequency/types/avoid), and value_propositions per domain (real estate, AI, SaaS). System prompts inject this so AI knows when/how to add soft CTAs that match the content.",

White-collar AI workers (ChatGPT/Claude users) have cool wins but don't capture them because it breaks flow. One click → captured → posts written → ready to share. 30 seconds instead of never. This is the difference between people who build in public and people who don't - removing the friction. Chrome extension = universal (works anywhere), email notification = no app needed, copy-paste = user stays in control. Market validation via pre-sell before building reduces risk.\n\nWhat's your experience with this?",

Researched viral content patterns (Twitter threads, LinkedIn articles, Instagram posts) and documented complete hook optimization system. Created two comprehensive docs: `HOOK-OPTIMIZATION.md` (system architecture) and `HOOK-COMPARISON.md` (before/after examples showing 40x engagement improvement).\n\nHotKey's value proposition is \"turn wins into 10 posts in 30 seconds\" but if those posts are boring, nobody reads them. The difference between a boring post (\"Designed a multi-agent pipeline...\") and a hooked post (\"Our AI agent kept failing at line 147. Context full. Memory lost. Here's the fix 🧵\") is 5 likes vs 500 likes. That's 40x more reach from better hooks alone.\n\nDiscovery: Current system generates posts via text manipulation (splitting sentences), not AI generation with platform-specific system prompts and hook patterns. The sophisticated templates we built aren't even being used. Fix requires: (1) Replace text manipulation with Claude API calls, (2) Create platform skills with proven hook patterns, (3) Inject user DNA into every generation, (4) Hook-first generation (generate 3-5 hooks, score them, pick best, build post around it).\n\nWhat's your experience with this?",

Outcome-oriented DNA makes every post subtly work toward specific goals - DM invites, partnership inquiries, early access signups. The difference between \"I post on Twitter\" and \"Twitter is my lead gen engine.\"\n\nKey insight: Already got one $9.5k proposal from Twitter content. With outcome-oriented posts (soft CTAs, conversation starters, relevant invites), that could happen weekly instead of randomly. Not every post needs a CTA, but when they do (1 in 3), they should align with actual business goals and feel natural, not pushy.\n\nImplementation: Add \"goals\" section to user DNA with primary_outcome, target_actions, cta_guidelines (style/frequency/types/avoid), and value_propositions per domain (real estate, AI, SaaS). System prompts inject this so AI knows when/how to add soft CTAs that match the content.\n\nWhat's your experience with this?",

Started with basic queue, ended with production-ready scheduling system + full automation plan.\n\n**UI Improvements:**\n- Added modal for unscheduled posts (click to open, edit content, schedule)\n- Drag-and-drop both ways: unscheduled → timeline AND timeline → unscheduled\n- Renamed \"Queue\" → \"Schedule\" (better UX terminology)\n- Post Now button in both UI Review and Schedule modals\n- Status system: unscheduled → scheduled → dismissed (with restore)\n- All 12 posts loading correctly (4 stories × 3 platforms)\n\n**Architecture Win:**\nDocumented complete Publer integration plan with optimized flow:\n1. `/story` → captures work + media\n2. AUTO: Generate all 3 platform posts (Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram) using hook optimization skills\n3. AUTO: Telegram notification: \"New post ready to review\"\n4. User opens UI Review → sees all variations\n5. User approves → moves to Schedule\n6. AUTO: Publer schedules at next best time per platform\n7. AUTO: Publer publishes at scheduled time\n\n**User's actual work:** `/story` + add media + approve. Everything else automated.\n\n**Technical Decisions:**\n- Generate all platforms at once (not iterative) - saves API calls and complexity\n- Use Publer for scheduling/posting (don't build own executor)\n- Media via public Netlify URLs (already served at hotkey-ai.netlify.app/review/media/)\n- Hook optimization skills for better content quality\n- Model: `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` (~$0.03 per story for 3 posts)\n\nThis is the difference between \"content tool\" and \"content factory.\"\n\nMost tools make you do:\n1. Write post manually\n2. Format for each platform\n3. Schedule each one\n4. Remember to post\n\nHotKey now does:\n1. You type `/story` and add screenshot\n2. AI generates optimized posts for all platforms\n3. You review and approve\n4. System auto-schedules and auto-posts\n\nThe hard parts (hook optimization, platform formatting, timing, actual posting) are automated. The human part (deciding what to share, verifying quality) stays human.\n\n**Real impact:**\n- User flow: 30 seconds of work vs 10+ minutes per story\n- Quality: Hook-optimized with proven patterns vs generic text\n- Consistency: Posts every day at best times vs whenever you remember\n- Scale: 3-5 stories/day sustainable vs 1-2 manually\n\nThis is production-ready. Just needs Publer API key and auto-generation watcher to go fully live.\n\nWhat's your experience with this?",
